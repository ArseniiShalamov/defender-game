## How to play (quick start)

1. Open the project locally and launch `index.html` in a browser.  
   - Easiest way (VS Code): install the “Live Server” extension → right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.
   - Or run any static server from the repo root:
     ```bash
     npx http-server .
     # or
     python3 -m http.server 8080
     ```
2. Controls are simple (move & shoot/defend). If unsure, check on-screen hints or read the code in `src/`.
